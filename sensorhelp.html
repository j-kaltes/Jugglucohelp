<body lang="en-US" dir="ltr"><h1>Sensor</h1>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0in"><font face="basic roman">T<font face="Liberation Serif, serif">he
spinner contains the name of the sensor. If Juggluco is using more
than one sensor at the same time, you can select </font><font face="Liberation Serif, serif">the</font><font face="Liberation Serif, serif">
sensor </font><font face="Liberation Serif, serif">for which </font><font face="Liberation Serif, serif">to
show information.</font></font></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0in"><a href="https://www.juggluco.nl/Jugglucohelp/battery.html"><font face="Liberation Serif, serif"><i><b>Doze
mode</b></i></font></a> <font face="Liberation Serif, serif">leads
you to a screen with information on how to disable battery
optimizations for Juggluco, that can prevent Juggluco from
functioning.</font></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0in"><font face="Liberation Serif, serif"><i><b>Bluetooth
history</b></i>: On Libre 2, history are values of the past in 15
minute intervals. Previously they were only received by scanning.
When you turn this option on, the History values are also received
via Bluetooth. Also, other things will work differently. To Libreview
will be sent the history values, instead of averages of the stream
values. The disadvantage is that it is slower. This can be an issue
on WearOS watches. This option has no effect on Libre 3 and US Libre
2 sensors; they always receive history values via Bluetooth.</font></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0in"><font face="Liberation Serif, serif"><i><b>Permission</b></i>:
Previous versions of Juggluco required location permission to find
the device address of the sensor. This is no longer necessary for the
sensors I use. Maybe there are still sensors out there for which it
is necessary; in that case you can turn it on. After the first
contact Juggluco saves the device address and location permission is
always useless. The device address, if known, is displayed after the
sensor identifier. Red means a US-like sensor. Android 12 has a new
<i>Nearby devices</i> permission, which can be used instead of
location permission for searching for a Bluetooth device address, but
it is also needed for later contact with Bluetooth devices.</font></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0in"><font face="Liberation Serif, serif"><i><b>Forget</b></i><i>:</i>
Let Juggluco forget the device address and scan for the device
address. For some sensors this is needed to get a connection and is
then done automatically by Juggluco. With this button you can
manually say that Juggluco should do that, because there are maybe
other occasions in which it is also needed.</font></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0in"><font face="Liberation Serif, serif"><i><b>Terminate</b></i>:
stop connecting to this sensor via Bluetooth. If later you want to
again receive stream glucose values from this sensor, you only have
to scan it again. If the sensor is directly connected with the watch,
you need first to turn that off and then press on <i>Terminate</i> on
the phone and then on <i>Sync</i> on the watch.</font></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0in"><font face="Liberation Serif, serif"><i><b>Turbo</b></i>:
Increases effort to contact with sensor in the hope that it results
in less connection errors, but can uses more battery power. Seems to
be needed on Watch4 with Freestyle Libre 2 sensors, but not with
Freestyle Libre 3 sensors and on none of the smartphones I tried it
on.</font></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0in"><font face="Liberation Serif, serif"><b>Android</b>:
Let Android instead of Juggluco make the connection with the sensor.
Don’t use it!</font></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0in"><font face="Liberation Serif, serif"><i><b>Info</b></i>:
Gives start and end times and last scan and stream times of sensor.</font></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0in"><font face="Liberation Serif, serif">To
connect to a Freestyle Libre 2 sensor via Low Energy Bluetooth,
Bluetooth should be turned on. Before the sensor is scanned
successfully by this app, nothing will happen. The sensor shouldn't
be connected with FreeStyle reader or other applets on smartphones.
Abbotts Librelink app's alarms should be turned off or the app
stopped. Some Librelink apps seem to contact the sensor while alarms
are turned off and can cause connection problems, so use '</font><font face="Liberation Serif, serif"><i>force
stop</i></font><font face="Liberation Serif, serif">' to be certain.
If you have started the sensor with Freestyle Reader and you can’t
turn it off, you can prevent it from getting into contact with the
sensor by putting the reader in a </font><a href="https://www.offgridweb.com/preparation/faraday-bags-testing-commercial-and-diy-wireless-signal-blockers/amp"><font face="Liberation Serif, serif"><u>Faraday

<p style="border: none; padding: 0in"><font face="Liberation Serif, serif"><b>Sensor
via Bluetooth/Use Bluetooth</b></font> <font face="Liberation Serif, serif">should
be turned on.</font></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0in"><font face="Liberation Serif, serif">If
the above conditions are satisfied, it can still take a long time
before the app receives glucose values from the sensor. Often it
takes a minute, but at other times it takes much longer. The
</font><font face="Liberation Serif, serif"><i>Connection stage</i></font>
<font face="Liberation Serif, serif">gives the most difficulties. The
most frequent are failures with status=133, which is the status
argument of </font><a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/bluetooth/BluetoothGattCallback#onConnectionStateChange(android.bluetooth.BluetoothGatt,%20int,%20int)"><font face="Liberation Serif, serif"><u>onConnectionStateChange(BluetoothGatt
bluetoothGatt, int status, int newState)</u></font></a><font face="Liberation Serif, serif">.
It means </font><font face="Liberation Serif, serif"><i>Bluetooth
device not found</i></font><font face="Liberation Serif, serif">.
Nearly always it just takes some time before the device is found. It
is also possible that the sensor is connected to another device,
temporary not functioning well, other devices are interfering or the
Bluetooth of Android doesn’t function. Sometimes turning Bluetooth
off and on seems to help or rebooting the phone or turning off the
Bluetooth connection of other devices. Other problems are sometimes
resolved by scanning the sensor. </font><font face="Liberation Serif, serif">Intervening
water (including body water) can be a problem, so that wearing a
WearOS watch on a different arm than the sensor can give connection
problems when the arms are held in a way that the body is positioned
between watch and sensor.</font></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0in"><font face="Liberation Serif, serif">Scanning
the sensor with Juggluco (with </font><font face="Liberation Serif, serif"><i>Sensor
via Bluetooth</i></font><font face="Liberation Serif, serif">
enabled) on another phone, will steal the connection away from this
phone and it can take some time, with scanning in between, to get it
back again.</font></p>
