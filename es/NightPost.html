<body lang="en-US" dir="ltr"><p>Subir a servidor Nightscout.</p>
<p>En la mayoría de los casos puedes usar el servidor web en Juggluco o
<a href="https://www.juggluco.nl/Juggluco/cmdline">juggluco-server</a>,
only AAPS and NSclient refuse to work when not connected to
<a href="https://github.com/nightscout/cgm-remote-monitor">cgm-remote-monitor</a>.
The web server in Juggluco also gives amounts in the form of
Nightscout treatments
(<a href="https://www.juggluco.nl/Juggluco/webserver.html">https://www.juggluco.nl/Juggluco/webserver.html</a>),
the uploader only uploads glucose values.</p>
<p>All stream values are uploaded to the Nightscout server at the
moment they arrive. When multiple sensor are used, all values of all
sensors are uploaded. Some Garmin watch apps/faces/widgets assume
that the values are space 5 minutes apart. When they receive glucose
values one minute apart, they will only show the last fifth of the
curve. For that reason, the webserver incorporated in Juggluco spaces
the values 5 minutes apart, except when &quot;interval=secs&quot; is
set to a lower value.</p>
<p><b>URL</b>: the url should be in the form of https://hostname:port
for example, https://myname.herokuapp.com:6789</p>
<p><b>Active</b>: Turn on uploader</p>
<p><b>Resend data</b>: Upload all data again to the Nightscout server</p>
<p><b>Send now</b>: Normally data is immediately send when it arrives
from the sensor or a mirror connection. Press on this button when for
some reason a previous attempt failed.</p>
<p>The WearOS version Juggluco 4.15.0 and later can also upload
glucose values to Nightscout. In nearly all cases you can better send
them via a Juggluco version on a phone or tablet or via Juggluco
server on a computer. It will drain the battery, especially when it
is unable to contact the Nightscout server, so you can better turn
<i>Active</i> off when there is no reliable connection.</p>
