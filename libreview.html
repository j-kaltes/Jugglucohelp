<body lang="en-US" dir="ltr"><h1>Libreview</h1>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Juggluco can send
glucose data and amounts to Libreview. 
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Like the Librelink
app, it sends data from the last 89 days to Libreview. 
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US">To
make use of this service, you need to create a Libreview account at
<a class="western" href="https://libreview.com/">https://libreview.com</a>
and specify its E-Mail address and password here.</span> <span lang="en-US">Don't
send data from the same period multiple times to the same Libreview
account (for example from the Librelink app and Juggluco). You can
delete existing devices in Libreview in Account Settings-&gt;My
devices or you can take a new Libreview account.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US">To
turn it on, you also need to check &quot;</span><span lang="en-US"><i><b>Send
to libreview</b></i></span><span lang="en-US"><i>&quot;</i></span><span lang="en-US">.
</span>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Juggluco will send
new data to Libreview every time you switch away from Juggluco when
it wasn't done in the previous 20 minutes. You can also manually send
it to Libreview by pressing <i>&quot;</i><i><b>Send now</b></i><i>&quot;</i>.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Beside glucose
values, amounts can also be sent to Libreview. For this you need to
touch &quot;<a class="western" href="https://www.juggluco.nl/Jugglucohelp/librenumhelp.html"><i><b>Send
amounts</b></i></a>&quot; and specify what each label means.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>RU</b>: You need
to set this if you make use of <a class="western" href="https://libreview.ru/">https://libreview.<span style="text-decoration: none"><b>ru</b></span></a>
instead of <a class="western" href="https://libreview.com/">https://libreview.com</a>.
This only applies to Libre 2 sensors. Libre 3 sensors can only be
used with libreview.com, because no Russian Abbott Libre 3 app
exists.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Immediate</b>:
Send glucose values to Libreview immediately when they arrive from
Libre 2 or 3 sensors. This is only useful in combination with
LibreLinkUp. To make use of it you need to add a LibrelinkUp
connection to this Libreview account in one of Abbott's Libre apps.
(If there is no Abbott Libre app in your country, you can use the
<a class="western" href="https://www.juggluco.nl/Juggluco/libre3/patched.html">patched
Libre 3 app</a>.) Sometimes the value is not immediately visible,
because display of <span style="font-weight: normal">LibreLinkUp</span>
isn't redrawn automatically. Using LibreLinkup is quite dangerous if
you don't look closely, because when you touch the graph, it shows an
old value instead of the current glucose value.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Spy Views</b>:
When this option is set, Juggluco will send to Libreview whether a
value is viewed or not. When this option is turned off, Juggluco will
always say that it is not viewed. This option will only reliably send
this information to Libreview when also <i>Immediate</i> is turned
on. Juggluco should be constantly connected to the internet to catch
all views from Libre 3, Libre 2 remembers them all as long as it is
not killed.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Change start</b>:
Start anew; resend data from a specified date and time. You need to
press this when switching to a new Libreview account.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Result of the last
time trying to send to Libreview is displayed below the &quot;Get
Account ID&quot; button.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Libreview uses the
history values for its analysis and Juggluco uses the stream values
for its statistics screen (<a class="western" href="https://www.juggluco.nl/Jugglucohelp/stathelp.html">left
middle menu-&gt;Statistics</a>).  This difference causes small
differences between Libreview and the statistics of Juggluco. Because
the stream values are more extreme, Juggluco is somewhat more
negative: lower time in range, larger variability. Also <i>time
sensor active</i> is smaller according to Juggluco; it counts every
missing stream value.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Juggluco can be
connected with multiple sensors at the same time, while Librelink
only handles one sensor at a time. Juggluco also sends data from only
one sensor at a time to Libreview. It does this by first sending the
data from one sensor and only after no data is available from that
sensor, it sends the data from the following sensor. When Juggluco is
switched to a following sensor, Juggluco will not turn back to a
previous one, to imitate the one sensor policy of Librelink. This
means that when you run multiple sensors at a time and a later added
one ends earlier than an earlier added sensor, this earlier sensor
will send no data anymore to Libreview.</p>
<p><a class="western" href="https://www.juggluco.nl/Jugglucohelp/getaccountidhelp.html"><b>Get
Account ID</b></a>: If you only want to receive the LibreView account
ID, but not send data to Libreview, you can fill in your E-Mail
address and Password and press on &quot;<a class="western" href="https://www.juggluco.nl/Jugglucohelp/getaccountidhelp.html"><i>Get
Account ID</i></a>&quot;. On the same line before this button, the
Account ID will be shown (this can take some time and the screen is
not refreshed automatically). Retrieving the Account ID from the
LibreView server makes it possible to use a FreeStyle Libre 3 sensor
that was already used with Abbotts Libre 3 app with this LibreView
account.</p>
<p>Data from Sibionics sensors is not sent to Libreview.</p>
