<body lang="en-US" dir="ltr"><h1>Watch</h1>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Currently, Juggluco
has six ways to get glucose values on your watch.</p>
<h2 class="western">Notify</h2>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US">When
</span><span lang="en-US"><i>Notify</i></span> <span lang="en-US">is
turned on, an Android notification is created every time a new
glucose value arrives. On some watches notifications are only sent to
the watch when a new notification is created, for them you have to
turn on </span><span lang="en-US"><i><b>Separate</b></i></span><span lang="en-US">.
For these watches you also have to switch on </span><span lang="en-US"><i>Separate</i></span>
<span lang="en-US">to receive alarm notifications on the watch.</span></p>
<h2 class="western">Watchdrip</h2>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">By switching this
on, Juggluco sends glucose values to <a href="https://bigdigital.home.blog/2022/06/16/watchdrip-a-new-application-for-xdrip-watch-integration">Watchdrip+</a>.
Watchdrip+ sends watch faces, showing glucose values, to
MiBand/Amazfit watches.</p>
<h2 class="western">GadgetBridge</h2>
<p><a href="https://gadgetbridge.org">GadgetBridge</a> makes it possible to display weather information on MiBand/Amazfit
watches. With the Gadgetbridge option turned on, will Juggluco send
glucose values to GadgetBridge under the pretext that it is weather
information. This had the advantage above Watchdrip that it is much
faster, but has the disadvantage that less information is displayed.
Juggluco puts the glucose value and a direction arrow in the location
of the weather. This location is displayed under Weather on the
watch. I haven't found any watch face that displayed this location.
Only for <b>mmol/L</b>: the value before the point is put in the
maximal temperature and the value after the point in the minimal
temperature. The values of <b>mg/dL</b> are too large for
temperatures, for that reason the last digit is put in minimal
temperature and the numbers before the last digit in the maximal
temperature. Thus 106 mg/dL becomes: maximal temperature 10, minimal
temperature 6.</p>
<p>The direction of change determines the weather icon: snow is
falling glucose, rain is rising glucose. It is also put in the
current temperature. Larger than zero means rising glucose, lower
than zero means falling glucose.</p>
<h2 class="western"><a href="https://www.juggluco.nl/Jugglucohelp/kerfstok.html">Kerfstok</a></h2>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US">Kerfstok
is watch app by which you can enter numbers (like insulin doses),</span>
<span lang="en-US">but it also displays the current glucose value.
Immediately as a new glucose value arrives, Juggluco sends it to
Kerfstok. So Kerfstok displays always the most recent glucose value.
Kerfstok can also record all activities supported by Garmin and can
display speed and distance. See Watch-&gt;Kerfstok Status-&gt; Help
and <a href="https://www.juggluco.nl/Kerfstok">https://www.juggluco.nl/Kerfstok</a></span></p>
<h2 class="western"><a href="https://www.juggluco.nl/Juggluco/glucosebroadcast.html">Broadcast</a></h2>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Apps can receive
glucose values from one of the glucose broadcasts sent by Juggluco
and send these glucose values to a watch. For example G-Watch
(<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=sk.trupici.g_watch">TizenOS</a>
or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=sk.trupici.gwatch.wear">WearOS</a>)
can receive glucose values from the Glucodata Broadcast (see Left
menu-&gt;<a href="https://www.juggluco.nl/Jugglucohelp/settinghelp.html">Settings</a>).</p>
<h2 class="western"><a href="https://www.juggluco.nl/Jugglucohelp/Nightscouthelp.html">xDrip watch apps</a></h2>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US">Juggluco
incorporates an xDrip/Nightscout</span> <span lang="en-US">webserver.
This makes it possible to directly use xDrip watch apps with
Juggluco. xDrip displays a new glucose value only every 5 minutes,
while Juggluco displays a new glucose value every minute. Juggluco
also sends to the xDrip watch apps the most recent glucose value. The
glucose values are only sent to the watches if the watch app asks for
them, thus how old the displayed values are depends on when the watch
app asks for them. For example watch faces and data fields on Garmin
watches only ask for a glucose value every 5 minutes. Via xDrip this
often let to 10 minute old glucose values. When directly connected
with Juggluco, these watch faces show up to 6 minute old glucose
values. Under </span><span lang="en-US"><b>Garmin</b></span><span lang="en-US">,
if you can't use Kerfstok, you have the following options to
regularly receive a recent glucose value. An xDrip widget
(<a href="https://apps.garmin.com/en-US/apps/73115e04-dc9f-4765-ad88-e7ae283ce995">https://apps.garmin.com/en-US/apps/73115e04-dc9f-4765-ad88-e7ae283ce995</a>)
can also be used during the recording of an activity. So if you have
a hand free, you can switch to this xDrip widget while recording an
activity with a standard Garmin sport app. There is also an xDrip
sport app that updates its glucose value regularly:
<a href="https://apps.garmin.com/en-US/apps/aaf6533b-bca1-4365-9131-9f882f6f148c">https://apps.garmin.com/en-US/apps/aaf6533b-bca1-4365-9131-9f882f6f148c</a>.
You can try to start at a moment, so that it will request a glucose
values just after it is available. Data fields and watch faces would
be the ideal solution, but restrictions imposed by Garmin make them
of little value. </span>

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US">According
to a user there exist also a watch face for </span><span lang="en-US"><b>Fitbit</b></span>
<span lang="en-US">watches that works with the web server in Juggluco:
<a href="https://glancewatchface.com/">https://glancewatchface.com</a></span></p>

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>local only</b>:
only accept connections from localhost (127.0.0.1). If you turn it
off, also other hosts can access the server. This only applies to
http, https is always possible. If you don't configure your firewall
to redirect to port 17580, this will be only hosts on your home
network.</p>
<h2 class="western"><a href="https://www.juggluco.nl/Jugglucohelp/wearosinfo.html">WearOS Juggluco</a></h2>
<p>There is a version of Juggluco ported to Wear OS. The display is
adapted to the smaller screen and a watch face is added. The watch
face can be installed as a usual Wear OS watch face and displays
beside the time also the current glucose value received via
Bluetooth.</p>
